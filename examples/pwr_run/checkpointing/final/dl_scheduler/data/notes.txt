baseline - baseline, unaware
baseline+ - random promotion
scheme - proposed scheme
feedback - measure speedup for every job
epoch_boundary - on top of proposed, nullify promotion/demotion pair if V100 job to be demoted has too much epoch waste time compare to its epoch time. Just for exploration purpose, this seems to make the scheme worse
start_on_both - start on both V100 and K80 instead of V100 only in proposed
no_safeguard - remove safeguard time from proposed
no_threshold - remove promotion/demotion pair speedup difference restriction
predict_error - added Gaussian noise to mode speedup prediction
